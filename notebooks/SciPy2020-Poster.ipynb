    "An interactive web application can take a powerful and complex Python workflow to the next level, drastically improve its utility, and enhance its ability to visualize results. The increased capabilities of open-source Python libraries have made the transition from Jupyter notebooks to production-ready web applications easier than ever. This talk will demonstrate how to prototype a web application in the notebook environment then easily deploy it as a stand-alone web application with Panel. Next, we will show how Panel applications can be transitioned to a fully-featured web application in the Tethys Platform."
